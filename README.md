Sure, here's an example README.md file that you can use on GitHub to describe the script that updates the build number, version number, and build date in an Xcode project:

# Xcode Build Number Script

This script updates the build number, version number, and build date in an Xcode project. It's useful for keeping track of different versions of your application and identifying individual builds within a specific version.

## How it works

The script is a bash script that uses the `PlistBuddy` tool to read and modify values in the Info.plist file of your Xcode project. It also uses the `git` command to obtain the abbreviated commit hash for the current version of your code.

When you run the script, it performs the following steps:

1. Reads the major and minor version numbers from the Info.plist file
2. Increments the patch version number and updates the version number in the Info.plist file
3. Gets the abbreviated Git commit hash and sets the build number in the Info.plist file to a string that includes the version number and commit hash
4. Sets the build date in the Info.plist file to the current date and time

## How to activate the script

To activate the script, follow these steps:

1. In Xcode, select your project in the project navigator and then select the target you want to add the script to.
2. Click on the "Build Phases" tab and then click on the "+" button in the top left corner to add a new build phase.
3. Select "New Run Script Phase" from the dropdown menu.
4. Copy and paste the script from the example above into the new script phase.
5. Save your changes and rebuild your project. Each time you build your project, the build number, version number, and build date will be updated.

Note: If your project has multiple targets, you will need to add this script to each target individually.
